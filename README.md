Also, this is an offline English Corner where located in Chengdu.

Good news! Our English corner is back! Feel free to come. But, you should know something about our EC before you come. 
1. Venue: (天府广场赛百味店外摆区)
2. Time: From 6:30pm to 8:30pm every Wednesday.
3. Topic: We have a topic each time and it will be sent to our “group document “(群文件)
4. It’s an opportunity to force you speaking English and thinking in English, so NO CHINESE during all the EC time.
5. Strongly suggest that you’d better be well prepared for the discussion unless your English is good enough to give an offhand talk.
6. If you decide to come, pls contact Edwin or Yuki.
